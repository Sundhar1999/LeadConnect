# Python flask

To create a virtual environment and install the Flask application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd /LeadConnect/leadconnect-backend/api-server-flask/
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Start the Flask application:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

You should now have the virtual environment set up and the Flask application running.

pip install -r requirements.txt
